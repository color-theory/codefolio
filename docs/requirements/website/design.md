**# Design Plan for a Modern Minimalist Website**

### **1. Overall Aesthetic and Layout**

- **Minimalist Approach**: The key is to keep the interface simple, reducing clutter so users can easily focus on the data. Use lots of **white space** (or dark equivalent) to create visual breathing room.
- **Dark Theme as Default**: Start with a **dark color palette** (charcoal, dark slate, etc.) for a sleek look, with light accents for buttons, icons, and important elements. Ensure the dark theme enhances readability by using **high-contrast colors** for text and interactive elements. Have an icon in the corner somewhere that toggles between light and dark theme. When a user first visits the site, show a popup saying "Current Theme: Dark" that persists until the user clicks either the X on the popup window, or clicks the theme toggle button to switch to light.
- **Grid Layout with CSS Grid and Flexbox**: Use **CSS Grid** for the overall page structure, which will help align elements neatly and maintain visual balance. Flexbox can be used within individual grid cells for precise alignment of smaller components. A **two or three-column layout** might be effective if you have different sections of data.
- **Centered Body and Layout Details**: Keep the body text area centered, not spanning more than about **80 characters** in width for readability. At the top, include a **header** with your name and a confident yet modest subheader, like "Full Stack Engineer with a Passion for Modern Solutions." Below that, add a **top navigation** with key links.

### **2. Top Navigation and Sections**

- **Main Navigation Items**:
  - **Envelope Icon**: An envelope icon should be present in the header of every page, which links directly to the Contact Form. This will allow users to reach out from anywhere on the site.
  - **CV**: The main CV section that combines relevant items.
    - **Sub-Navigation Items**:
      - **Biography**: A brief biography and photo.
      - **Education**: Display educational background as would be on a resume.
      - **Tech**: A list of technologies that you're proficient in.
  - **Reading**: A section for reading materials.
    - **Sub-Navigation Items**:
      - Each item will be a particular book or essay that I've read.
  - **Portfolio**: A visual representation of projects or creative works.
  - **Blog**: Share short updates and experiences during your career, making it easy to provide content without the pressure of long-form blogging.
    - **Sub-Navigation Items**:
      - Each item will be a title for the microblog it relates to.
  - **Contact**: The default page will be the contact form, allowing users to get in touch directly.
    - **Sub-Navigation Items**:
      - **Contact Form**: A page with a form that users can use to contact me.
      - **External Links**: A sub-section that includes external links such as LinkedIn and GitHub for further engagement. All external links should be denoted with an icon next to them indicating they lead to an external site, and they should open in a new tab.
  - **Expanded Features**:
    - Include a **Login Option** for visitors who want to interact with the site more, such as accessing demos of your projects that utilize your API (e.g., a todo list or other sample projects). This will demonstrate authentication skills and give you metrics on who visits the page.

### **3. Content Management**

- **Markdown Files for Content**: Write the main text content for each page as **Markdown files** and render them as HTML. This allows for easy editing and updating of content without diving into the codebase. Markdown is simple, readable, and effective for writing rich content while keeping the formatting manageable.

### **4. Color Scheme and Typography**

- **Accent Colors**: Choose one or two **traditional Japanese colors** that pair well with subdued beiges, such as **Shu iro (vermilion)**, **Mizuasagi (pale teal)**, or **Kohaku (amber)** that will pop against the dark background. Use them sparingly for call-to-action buttons, hyperlinks, and active states.
- **Custom Typography**: Pick a modern yet minimalist typeface for headings, such as **Poppins**, **Montserrat**, or **Inter**. These fonts convey simplicity but have character. For body text, choose something highly readable, like **Roboto** or **Open Sans**.
- **Variable Fonts**: Consider **variable fonts** that can adjust weight and slant dynamically, adding subtle emphasis and keeping the text feeling lively without needing multiple typefaces.

### **5. Animation and Interactivity**

- **Micro-Interactions**: To add some sparkle without cluttering the design, include **micro-interactions**. These can be small hover animations for buttons or input fields, which provide instant feedback and create an engaging experience.
  - Use tools like **Framer Motion** or **CSS animations** to achieve these.
- **Scroll Animations**: Consider adding subtle **scroll-triggered animations** to bring in elements as users scroll, providing a sense of flow and dynamism. These could be slight fades, slides, or scaling effects.
  - Make sure the animations are **delicate and purposeful**, so they enhance rather than distract.

### **6. Dark Mode Considerations**

- **High Contrast**: In dark mode, ensure that text remains legible with appropriate contrast ratios. Utilize **soft whites** (off-whites) rather than harsh pure white to reduce eye strain.
- **Theme Toggle**: Integrate a **theme toggle switch** early on, even if you start with only the dark theme. This will future-proof the UI for potential light theme users.

### **7. Accessibility and User Experience**

- **Keyboard Navigation and Focus Indicators**: Ensure that all animations and visual elements are easy to navigate with a keyboard. Include **focus styles** that are visually distinctive in dark mode.
- **Accessible Typography**: Text should be comfortably readable at default sizes, with line heights and letter spacing that ease readability on all screen sizes.

### **8. Language Selection for Future Expansion**

- **Plan for Multi-language Support**: Design your layout in such a way that elements have enough room to accommodate **language expansion**. Some languages, like German or Japanese, might require more space.
- **Language Toggle**: Start designing with a **language toggle** placeholder, even if it's not functional yet. This will help plan the best location for it within your UI, likely in the **navigation bar** or as a **footer element**.

### **9. Tools and Inspirations**

- **Figma** or **Adobe XD**: Start by sketching your ideas digitally to experiment with layouts and color schemes. Use **design systems** or explore **Dribbble** for inspiration.
- **Coolors.co** or **Adobe Color**: For refining your dark palette and accent colors.
- **LottieFiles**: If you want to add **SVG animations** to bring some small custom animations into the design.

### **Next Steps**

- **Wireframe and Prototype**: Create a wireframe of the layout to visualize where elements will be placed and how users will interact with them.
- **Typography and Color Tests**: Test some typefaces and colors on-screen to see how they blend together in dark mode.
- **Experiment with Animations**: Try out a few subtle animations using CSS or Framer Motion and see which ones enhance the flow without distracting.
