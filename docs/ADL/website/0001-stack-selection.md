# {Use MERN Stack for Website}

## Context and Problem Statement

Need to decide what stack to use for front end and backend for the website.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* Needs to be lightweight enough to host on my limited AWS creds.
* Performance is important. Caching?
* Modernity and Popularity of stack are important for this project.
* Allows me to show off my full-stack skills.

## Considered Options

* MERN
* Serverless
* LAMP

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: MERN w/ Serverless + .NET and Python, because it combines some of the most popular front and backend technologies,
allows me to show that I can design systems that integrate multiple frameworks, and allows me to show off my full-stack chops.

### Consequences

* Good, because it will cover a lot of the technologies for which I may be required to know at a new job. The frameworks available
for this stack are modern and widely supported.
* Bad, because it is a bit overkill for a single website, it will require more boilerplate to implement, may cost a bit more to host
than other alternatives, and will require me to completely overhaul my current server configuration.
