# 01 - Introduction

### Correctness vs. Efficiency
This is the real world we're talking about. While we engineers tend to strive for the most precise answers possible, sometimes it is only required that we find an acceptable one. Fuzzy inputs, resource constraints, and timelines can affect the amount of precision we'll be able to provide in many aspects of our jobs, and algorithms are no different.

Added `Size` and `Complexity` often leads to more required `Resources`.

### Math is Unavoidable
There are strategies that can be utilized to decrease the cost of workign with algorithms. Mathmeticians use tricks to get more output from less computing. IE: If it's been proven that x always equals y + some constant z, but you have an algorithm that finds x by doing a series of complex calculations solely on y, you can save yourself a lot of time and effort by using the constant z. Furthermore, if you have a single large algo defined to solve a problem, it can sometimes be more efficient to run a bevy of smaller, simpler algos in parallel that combined lead to the answer you want.
