# Algorithms
Derusting my algorithm fundamentals in Python, C#, and Typescript.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is three-fold:
- Prepare myself for for formal conversations about algorithms and datastructures in job interviews.
- Become even more familiar with Python, C#, and Typescript
- Update my online CV.


I think I'd like to do something fun with this project. Maybe I'll have it spin up a webserver, host the markdown files as notes as pages in a react website, but also grab the various code that I write and output those directly as the source code examples in a tabular design.
